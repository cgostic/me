<p>Hi there, my name is Cari! I'm a graduate student at the University of British Columbia, 
and will graduate with a Master's degree in Data Science in July, 2020. I'm very excited
about everthing I'm learning in the Master of Data Science program, and see countless opportunities
to apply data science to social and environmental issues. I wish to pursue a career that allows 
me to directly contribute something good to the world.</p>
