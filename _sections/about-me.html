<p>Hi there, my name is Cari! I began my academic career studying atmospheric science at Cornell University where I focused my studies on climate change. It's safe to say that I got a bit worried about the state of the earth and its inhabitants over those four years, as hockey-stick graphs and melting ice caps floated through my stress dreams. Because of my realistic pessimism about the future of our biosphere, I've decided to do something to help. To help people, animals, the earth, to help further our understanding of the world around us, I'm not very picky. Enter: Data Science. 

I truly believe that data can bring so much good to the world. Data is everywhere. It's powerful and beautiful, sometimes fun, and often makes me pull my hair out. Most importantly, data holds the answers to many of societies biggest problems (as soon as we figure out who, what, when, where and most importantly, how to find them). I'm very excited to pursue a career that allows me to use my newfound data science skills to contribute something good to the world.

Outside of work and academia, to be honest, I watch a lot of tv. I'm not really interested in content that isn't meant to make me laugh. My favorite movie is My Cousin Vinny and my favorite TV show is Fleabag. In addition to sitting on the couch, I love to hike and am happiest above the treeline. The greatest decision I ever made was to take a service job in Grand Teton National Park the summer after I graduated college. I enjoy photography, mostly landscapes, and am slowly learning how to use my camera outside of "Auto" mode. I love to read, and try to do so for at least 10 minutes each day. I have torn multiple ligaments playing ultimate frisbee, but it's too much fun to call it quits!
